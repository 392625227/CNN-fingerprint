# cnn-fingerprint
fingerprint verification using convolutional neural networks

In this project, the architecture of the cnn is same as mnist handwritten digits architecture, thanks to
https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py

also using keras library, with Theano as backend

The fingerprint data set is from NIST dataset, thanks to https://www.nist.gov

The average accuracy from 10 times experiments with same data and configuration is 73,90%
