# cnn-fingerprint
fingerprint verification using convolution neural networks

In this project, the architecture of the cnn is same as mnist handwritten digits architecture, also using keras library, with Theano as backend

The fingerprint data set is from NIST dataset, thanks to https://www.nist.gov

The average accuracy from 10 times experiments with same data and configuration is 73,90%
